This is a project based learning assignment where I am creating a Notes API.

Users should be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete notes.

The note will have values assigned to it:

- id
- title
- content
- createdAt

The API endpoints should allow for viewing access to all notes, or just notes by ID

POST // /notes
GET // /notes
GET // /notes/:id
PUT // /notes/:id
DELETE // /notes/:id
